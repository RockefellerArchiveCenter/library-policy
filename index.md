title: "Rockefeller Archive Center Library Collection Management Policy"
---

The Rockefeller Archive Center (RAC) collects non-unique published resources (which are not acquired as part of an archival collection) in a limited way consistent with the organization’s [Collection Policy](/collection-policy). Because of limited space, the RAC library is not a comprehensive resource for published literature by and about every subject, organization, or individual represented in the RAC’s archival holdings, nor does it serve as the repository of all works published by researchers who have conducted research at the RAC or that refer to RAC holdings.

## Cataloging 
The RAC library currently uses the Dewey Decimal System for cataloging. Cataloging is performed as needed by an outside vendor, and the data is managed in version control software by the RAC.

Published resources acquired as part of, or connected by provenance to, an archival collection will be described as part of that archival collection and not as part of the RAC library.

## Formats
The RAC library collection primarily includes books, but also some larger pamphlets and brochures. However, even if an item is bound, printed, or non-unique, consideration should be given to its provenance before transferring or adding it to the library collection. 

## Duplicate Copies of External Publications 
No more than two copies of any book will be acquired, cataloged, and added to the library collection.

## Duplicate Copies of Internal Publications 
Books and other publications authored, produced, and published or sponsored by the RAC will be given special attention. Depending upon their contents and usage, the RAC library may add up to four copies to the collection.

## Stray Issues of Journals/Magazines 
Stray issues/volumes of journals/magazines should be housed, arranged, and described as part of the archival collections with which they were acquired. They will not be cataloged and added to the library collection unless there is direct evidence that a complete issue or volume was sponsored by the RAC or by a donor/depositor organization. In exceptional cases, commemorative issues or volumes dealing with the RAC's goals and mission may be cataloged.

## Brochures and Pamphlets less than 50 pages 
Small publications, such as brochures, pamphlets, and other items less than fifty pages will be considered archival materials, removed from the library to the archival collections, and managed and described in accordance with the RAC’s archival policies and procedures, including the collection policy, re-appraisal policy, and processing manual.

## Loose Leaf Items
Loose leaf and spiral bound publications will be cataloged and added to the library collection like any other books.

## Highly Scientific & Technical Publications 
Such materials will only be cataloged and added to the RAC library collection if such books were sponsored, produced, or published by the RAC or by a donor/depositor organization. Otherwise, such materials should be housed, arranged, and described as part of the archival collections with which they were acquired.

## Disposal 
Library items identified for disposal under this policy should be clearly marked as "Discard", any cataloging information specific to the items should be removed from RAC discovery systems, and the items may be offered to staff for personal use. Once an item has been identified as a discard, it should not be incorporated back into the library collection at a later date. Any discard items not taken by staff for personal use should be properly disposed of in accordance with RAC Collections Management practices.
